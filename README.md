This is the unofficial module for Meyer Sound Galaxy.

Tested with real and virtual Galaxy, compatible with 408, 816, 816AES and 816Bluehorn

I starting coding this using ChatGPT5 in August 2025 during the main act of a festival I was doing. Yeah, no sh\*\*. I am nowhere near a real programmer, and I have profound respect for all of you guys. I spend around 10 hours in total so far. Lot of prompt and test here and there and various GUI improvement.

Amazingly, technology can bring an idea to life even if you know only a little about programming. What an era!

Basic actions, feedback and variables have been implemented. More to come. Don't hesitate to Reach out if you have an idea and a specific need.

Thanks to JosÃ© Gaudin to provide the ideas and his help!

Control your Meyer Sound Galaxy processors directly from Bitfocus Companion.
This module provides full integration with real-time control, variables, and feedback for inputs, outputs, matrices, snapshots, hardware status and more.

I only implement what I needed so far but there is more to come. Let me know if something you need is missing!

ðŸ”§Setup 1. In Companion, add the Meyer Sound Galaxy module. 2. Configure:
â€¢ IP Address of the Galaxy
â€¢ Port (default: 25003) 3. After connection, the module will automatically subscribe to all inputs, outputs, matrices, clocks, and status channels. 4. Variables, feedbacks, and presets are instantly available for use in your Companion buttons.

âœ¨Features Action's

    â€¢ Speaker Test:
        Cycles through your outputs automatically so you can quickly test speaker lines. 
        You can run it one output at a time (solo) or in pairs (A+B). 
        The timing between steps is adjustable, and outputs are muted/unmuted automatically during the chase.

    Inputs
    â€¢ Mute/unmute/toggle
    â€¢ Set, nudge, or fade gain (dB)
    â€¢ Variables for input name, mute state, and gain value
    â€¢ Feedback for mute status and gain levels
    Outputs
    â€¢ Mute/unmute/toggle
    â€¢ Set, nudge, or fade gain (dB)
    â€¢ Variables for output name, mute state, and gain value
    â€¢ Feedback for mute status and gain levels
    Matrix
    â€¢ Select multiple inputs and outputs at once
    â€¢ Set, nudge, or fade crosspoint gains
    â€¢ Variables and feedback for all crosspoints

    Snapshots
    â€¢ Recall snapshots (0â€“255)
    â€¢ Variables for active snapshot (ID, name, timestamps, etc.)
    â€¢ Feedback for snapshot state
    Presets
    â€¢ Auto-generated mute buttons for inputs and outputs
    â€¢ Labels show channel number, name, and gain
    â€¢ Feedback coloring (e.g. red when muted)
    Front Panel Lockout
    â€¢ Lock/unlock Galaxy hardware front panel
    â€¢ Feedback shows live state

    Status & System Info
    â€¢ Device info (model, firmware, serial, group name)
    â€¢ Clock & sync (AES, word clock, system clock)
    â€¢ Network status (IP, MAC, speed, etc.)
    â€¢ RTC date & time

ðŸ“Š Variables

    Example variables you can use in button labels:
    â€¢ $(Galaxy:input_1_name) â†’ Input 1 name
    â€¢ $(Galaxy:input_1_gain_db) â†’ Input 1 gain in dB
    â€¢ $(Galaxy:input_1_mute) â†’ true/false mute state
    â€¢ $(Galaxy:output_3_name) â†’ Output 3 name
    â€¢ $(Galaxy:snapshot_active_id) â†’ Currently active snapshot ID

ðŸ–² Feedbacks
â€¢ Input/output mute status (turns red when muted)
â€¢ Gain threshold comparisons (equal, above, below target dB)
â€¢ Matrix crosspoint gain monitoring
â€¢ Front panel lock state

âš¡ Notes
â€¢ Requires Companion v4 or newer, (may work with v3 but not tested)
â€¢ Tested with Meyer Sound Galaxy hardware (firmware version 2.9.1) but
should work with any version since Compass v4
Not compatible with Galileo/Callisto
â€¢ Community-driven, unofficial module. Use at your own risk
