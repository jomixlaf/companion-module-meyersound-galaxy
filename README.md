Control your Meyer Sound Galaxy processors directly from Bitfocus Companion.
This module provides full integration with real-time control, variables, and feedback for inputs, outputs, matrices, snapshots, hardware status and more.

I only implement what I needed so far but there is more to come. Let me know if something you need is missing!

â¸»
ðŸ”§ Setup
	1.	In Companion, add the Meyer Sound Galaxy module.
	2.	Configure:
	â€¢	IP Address of the Galaxy
	â€¢	Port (default: 25003)
	3.	After connection, the module will automatically subscribe to all inputs, outputs, matrices, clocks, and status channels.
	4.	Variables, feedbacks, and presets are instantly available for use in your Companion buttons.


âœ¨ Features Action's

	
â€¢	Speaker Test: 
    Cycles through your outputs automatically so you can quickly test speaker lines. You can run it one output at a time        (solo) or in pairs (A+B). The timing between steps is adjustable, and outputs are muted/unmuted automatically during        the chase.
	
 Inputs
	  â€¢	Mute/unmute/toggle one
	  â€¢	Set, nudge, or fade gain (dB)
	  â€¢	Variables for input name, mute state, and gain value
	  â€¢	Feedback for mute status and gain levels
	
 Outputs
	  â€¢	Mute/unmute/toggle one or multiple channels
	  â€¢	Set, nudge, or fade gain (dB)
	  â€¢	Variables for output name, mute state, and gain value
	  â€¢	Feedback for mute status and gain levels
	
 Matrix
	â€¢	Select multiple inputs and outputs at once
	â€¢	Set, nudge, or fade crosspoint gains
	â€¢	Variables and feedback for all crosspoints


Snapshots
	  â€¢	Recall snapshots (0â€“255)
	  â€¢	Variables for active snapshot (ID, name, timestamps, etc.)
	  â€¢	Feedback for snapshot state
	
Presets
  	â€¢	Auto-generated mute buttons for inputs and outputs
	  â€¢	Labels show channel number, name, and gain
	  â€¢	Feedback coloring (e.g. red when muted)
	
Front Panel Lockout
	â€¢	Lock/unlock Galaxy hardware front panel
	â€¢	Feedback shows live state

Status & System Info
	â€¢	Device info (model, firmware, serial, group name)
	â€¢	Clock & sync (AES, word clock, system clock)
	â€¢	Network status (IP, MAC, speed, etc.)
	â€¢	RTC date & time


ðŸ“Š Variables

Example variables you can use in button labels:
	â€¢	$(Galaxy:input_1_name) â†’ Input 1 name
	â€¢	$(Galaxy:input_1_gain_db) â†’ Input 1 gain in dB
	â€¢	$(Galaxy:input_1_mute) â†’ true/false mute state
	â€¢	$(Galaxy:output_3_name) â†’ Output 3 name
	â€¢	$(Galaxy:snapshot_active_id) â†’ Currently active snapshot ID

â¸»

ðŸ–² Feedbacks
	â€¢	Input/output mute status (turns red when muted)
	â€¢	Gain threshold comparisons (equal, above, below target dB)
	â€¢	Matrix crosspoint gain monitoring
	â€¢	Front panel lock state

âš¡ Notes
	â€¢	Requires Companion v3 or newer
	â€¢	Tested with Meyer Sound Galaxy hardware (firmware version 4.15)
	â€¢	Community-driven, unofficial module. Use at your own risk, but stable in production.
